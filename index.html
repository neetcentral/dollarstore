<h3> melodramatic overromanticized bullshit </h3>
<br>
<p>
every night i fall<br>
deeper and deeper<br>
away from<br>
		myself<br>
and<br>
		my world<br>
i want to reach out<br>
but i cannot<br>
i'm unsure why<br>
but it's killing me<br>
	</p>


<p>
"mystery"<br>
brown?<br>
green?<br>
officially, blue.<br>
some combination?<br>
either a mixture or a blend<br>
to be honest im not quite sure<br>
to be honest neither is anyone<br>
i think its strange that the eye of the beholder<br>
cannot see itself<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
"tinnitus"<br>
the ringing in my ears<br>
reigns perpetually.<br>
pulsating patterns tear<br>
straight through my head.<br>
i dont dislike it;<br>
a unique melody known only to me.<br>
it can quickly be forgotten,<br>
and often so,<br>
but it still remains,<br>
softly,<br>
behind everything else.<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
"before i left"<br>
before i left<br>
we were friends<br>
lovers, some thought<br>
(and i had wished)<br>
before i left<br>
we were friends<br>
and we had the world<br>
(but mostly the island)<br>
before i left<br>
we were friends<br>
but you drifted away<br>
(and i couldnt hold on)<br>
since i left<br>
we are hardly friends<br>
we dont even talk<br>
(but i still think of you)<br>
since i left<br>
we are barely friends<br>
i miss you terribly<br>
(but you dont respond)<br>
since i left<br>
we arent friends<br>
not anymore<br>
(oh i wish we were)<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
"new life"<br>
today is different from yesterday<br>
obviously<br>
but in a different sense<br>
not literal yesterday;<br>
the dumb, theoretical, metaphorical one<br>
i used to think that i wasnt going anywhere<br>
that everything was here to stay<br>
oh how wrong i was<br>
i took it all for granted<br>
foolishly<br>
to be fair, thats all i am<br>
a fool<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
"fomo"<br>
i feel like im missing out on something<br>
an experience<br>
a good time<br>
a celebration<br>
consistently<br>
i feel like everyone else is enjoying themselves<br>
and im not;<br>
wallowing<br>
fading<br>
drowning<br>
away from social normality<br>
and i want a way out.<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
"5:33 am"<br>
every night i sit up on my computer<br>
smashing my fingers into the keyboard<br>
clumsily<br>
attempting to make sense of all that im feeling<br>
it accomplishes nothing;<br>
except for maybe screwing up my sleep schedule<br>
which is fucking me up worse in the long run<br>
how can i break this cycle?<br>
</p>

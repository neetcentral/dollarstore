<h3>
TOXICITY - System of a Down, 2001 (Alternative Metal, Nu Metal)
</h3>
<p>
System of a Down's sophomore effort, Toxicity, is - to be frank, legendary.<br>
The heavy-hitting drums and pounding guitar chords combined with the lyrics<br>
of protest taken from punk underground, it is truly a record for the 21st <br>
century. This album really has its moments - with legendary tracks such as<br>
Chop Suey! and Toxicity, but also some of the more glanced over ones like <br>
Science. Serj Tankian, assisted by Daron Malakian, delievers a strong vocal<br>
performance that is simply one-of-a-kind. The focal point of the album is the <br>
current state of America mid-2001, with many of the issues still carrying over<br>
into today. Topics such as environmentalism, police brutality, and drug abuse <br>
are issues we continue to see almost 20 years later. This forces one to ask<br>
themself - Was this album truly ahead of its time? Or is it that Americans did<br>
not truly rebel, and that the issues we face now are not parallel, but rather<br>
are the same issues that linger? Problems solved or not, Toxicity is an <br>
important entry in the history of American music that transcends generation.<br>
<br>
ADD. TRACK THOUGHTS /// Noteworthy things about certain tracks I should share.
<br>
Prison Song - Discusses the issues with the American prison system, and how<br>
it profits off of its inmates. In between frustrated yells and screams, <br>
Tankian incorporates statistics and political talking points on the subject.<br>
<br>
X - Referring to the Armenian genocide of 1915, the band emphasizes how it<br>
has impacted their culture (the band consisting of four Armenian-Americans),<br>
this track shows that they do not want other people to go through the persecution<br>
their ancestors faced, which actively happens today.<br>
<br>
Bounce - Honestly kind of detracts from the album for me. While it adds to<br>
the band's humerous take on music, it seems to discount the politically- <br>
charged statements they make otherwise. <br>
<br>
Chop Suey! - legendary / 10<br>
<br>
FINAL SCORE - 8.7/10 <br>
Its strengths are many, but SOAD seem to drop the ball on tracks such as<br>
Jet Pilot and Bounce take away some of the sincerity brought on by the<br>
other tracks.<br>
